# pwnagotchi State Api

Throw the py file and state-api directory into the plugins directory. 

## Installation
Perform a git clone from here.
The ```state-api.py``` file goes in the plugins/defaults directory, or wherever you want to put your custom plugins
The files in goes_in_ui_web has to go in ```/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/pwnagotchi/ui/web``` unless you want to put them in ```/usr/local/src/pwnagotchi/pwnagotchi/ui/web/``` and perform a ```pip3 install .```

## Configuration

```
  plugins:
    state-api:
      enabled: true
      theme: minimal # optional - can be default, minimal,darkmode or hotdog. Uses state-default.html by default.
```

It takes information from the display state, as well as the `/api/v1/mesh/data` and `/api/v1/mesh/peers` providers. 

Call `/plugins/state-api/` to retrieve the default page

Call `/plugins/state-api/json` to retrieve the state JSON

## I Want to make my own theme!

Themes go in /ui/web/templates/

state-default.html is a good start. Name your file `state-{name_of_theme}.html`

For example, I renamed state-default.html to state-darkmode.html and set the background and color CSS.

There are some useful variables passed when the page is rendered:
``{{ title }}`` - the name of the pwnagotchi
``{{ show_buttons }}`` - whether show_buttons is set in the config. You can use this to alter the page/javascript.
``{{ other_mode }}`` - the opposite mode to the one we're in now
``{{ fingerprint }}`` - the fingerprint of the agent - you can use this to go to the page in pwnagotchi.ai 

Bear in mind - I've kept it simple, and everything in one page. This avoids complicating the plugin, but also saves your browser accessing random sites for libraries. Most of the JavaScript you need should be in state-default.html

### Theme ideas
I use the JSON to output to a dashboard holding the details of all my gotchis. You could use one HTML page to reference multiple gotchis on your network. 

There's nothing to stop the web page from holding historical data - how about making the temperature/cpu/memory a JS Graph over time? :D
